# Middleware in Express.js

## Introduction to Middleware

In Express.js, **middleware** refers to functions that execute during the lifecycle of a request to a server. Middleware functions have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. Middleware can execute any code, modify the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware in the stack.

The most common use of middleware is to modify or process incoming requests before they reach their final handler. Middleware functions are executed in the order they are defined in the code.

### Middleware Signature

Middleware functions typically take three parameters:

```javascript
function middlewareFunction(req, res, next) {
    // Middleware logic
    next(); // Call the next middleware in the stack
}
```

- **`req`**: The request object.
- **`res`**: The response object.
- **`next`**: A function that, when called, passes control to the next middleware function. If the middleware does not call `next()`, the request-response cycle will stop, and the server will hang.

## Types of Middleware

### 1. Application-Level Middleware
Application-level middleware binds to an instance of an Express app using `app.use()` or `app.METHOD()`. 

#### Example:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Application-level middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Request Type:', req.method);
  next(); // Pass control to the next middleware
});

// Route handler
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Home Page');
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

### 2. Router-Level Middleware
Router-level middleware works similarly to application-level middleware but is bound to an instance of `express.Router()`.

#### Example:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const router = express.Router();

// Router-level middleware
router.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Router Middleware Triggered');
  next();
});

router.get('/user', (req, res) => {
  res.send('User Page');
});

app.use('/api', router); // Apply router-level middleware

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

### 3. Built-in Middleware
Express comes with some built-in middleware functions, such as `express.static`, `express.json`, and `express.urlencoded`.

#### Example:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Built-in middleware to serve static files
app.use(express.static('public'));

// Built-in middleware to parse JSON requests
app.use(express.json());

// Built-in middleware to parse URL-encoded form data
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

app.post('/submit', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`Form data received: ${req.body}`);
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

### 4. Third-Party Middleware
Third-party middleware modules can be installed via npm and used in an Express app. Popular third-party middleware includes `morgan` for logging, `cors` for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, and `body-parser` for parsing incoming request bodies.

#### Example using `morgan`:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const morgan = require('morgan');
const app = express();

// Use morgan middleware for logging requests
app.use(morgan('dev'));

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Home Page');
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

### 5. Error-Handling Middleware
Error-handling middleware is used to catch and handle errors in an application. It has the same parameters as regular middleware but with an additional `err` parameter as the first argument.

#### Example:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Regular route handler
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  throw new Error('An unexpected error occurred!');
});

// Error-handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something went wrong!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

## Middleware Flow

In an Express app, middleware functions are executed in the order in which they are defined. When a request is received, Express executes each middleware in sequence, passing control to the next middleware using the `next()` function. If `next()` is not called, the request-response cycle is halted.

#### Example of Middleware Sequence:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// First middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('First Middleware');
  next(); // Pass control to the next middleware
});

// Second middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Second Middleware');
  next(); // Pass control to the next middleware
});

// Route handler
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from Route Handler');
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

#### Output:

```
First Middleware
Second Middleware
```

The request will pass through both middleware functions before reaching the final route handler.

## Common Middleware Examples and Their Usage

### 1. `express.json()`
This built-in middleware parses incoming requests with JSON payloads and is based on `body-parser`.

#### Usage:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Parse JSON request bodies
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/data', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body); // Access the parsed JSON data
  res.send('JSON data received');
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

### 2. `cors()`
The `cors` middleware allows you to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for your API, so it can be accessed from different domains.

#### Installation:

```bash
npm install cors
```

#### Usage:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const app = express();

// Enable CORS for all routes
app.use(cors());

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('CORS-enabled route');
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

### 3. `morgan()`
`morgan` is a middleware that logs HTTP requests and is useful for debugging and monitoring purposes.

#### Installation:

```bash
npm install morgan
```

#### Usage:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const morgan = require('morgan');
const app = express();

// Log HTTP requests using morgan
app.use(morgan('combined')); // 'combined' format logs detailed information

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Check the logs');
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

### 4. Custom Middleware Example
You can write your own middleware for tasks like authentication, logging, etc.

#### Example: Simple Logging Middleware

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Custom logging middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next(); // Pass control to the next middleware or route
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Home Page');
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

## Conclusion

Middleware in Express.js is a powerful mechanism that helps manage and control the flow of requests and responses in a web application. You can use built-in middleware, third-party middleware, or create your own to add functionality such as logging, security, and request parsing. By organizing middleware in the proper sequence, you can create clean and maintainable Express applications.
